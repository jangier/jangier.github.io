Jessica has always been a lover of numbers and as such, has really centered her career and later, her company, around coming up with innovative ways to create value with data. Previous to co-founding Hybrid Intelligence, which offers intelligent planning and analysis solutions, she held many roles working both for and with Fortune 100 companies in areas of data analysis and reporting, business intelligence, solutions consulting, and product development.

This site is my attempt at organization of my projects, experiments, academic learnings, and playings with all the data.
